# TinDog-website
Website based on an online course project. Designed to use some advanced CSS and Bootstrap responsiveness/features.
So the Personal Site and My CSS site have been helpful in terms of getting used to HTML and CSS, but neither of them look like a modern website, nor are they responsive to the viewport.
This TinDog site is designed to look modern, professional, and generally *better* than the previous websites. This was my first project created using Bootstrap, so it is responsive to the viewport unlike the previous websites, and generally has a bit more functionality and features, most notably the navbar, buttons, carousel and cards.
